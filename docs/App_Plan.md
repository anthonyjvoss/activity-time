# High Level Plan

> Get all the thoughts out of my head to plan out the app layout, flow, etc

## App Structure

* Main app homepage
  * Select activity type from the drop-down list
    * TODO: move away from hard-coded to database?
  * Display the activity info and activity cards
    * Pills with tags (eventually part of search/filter)
  * TODO: Ability to search/filter (i.e. loud or quiet)
